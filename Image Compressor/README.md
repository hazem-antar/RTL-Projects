## Overview of ECE744 project 1

### Objective

The main objective of the first ECE744 project is to make students comfortable working on a larger design (than the labs) that also includes implementing several types of digital signal processing primitives. In addition, the design and implementation must meet frequency and latency constraints while ensuring that hardware resources are not wasted.

### Preparation

* Revise the five labs
* Read [this](doc/ece744-project1-description.pdf) detailed project document and get familiarized with the software model from the `sw` subfolder 

### Evaluation

Push your source code and a 6-page report to GitHub before the end of March 6. The report should be in .pdf format and placed in the `doc` subfolder.
